🧩 Challenge Task
Create a Simple Image Gallery using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Your gallery should:

Display one image at a time.
Include “Previous” and “Next” buttons to navigate through the images.
When users click on the buttons, the gallery should show the previous or next image accordingly.
The gallery should loop — clicking “Next” on the last image goes back to the first image, and vice versa.
Add basic styling to make the gallery look neat and centered on the page.

🪄 Optional enhancements (extra credit):

Add smooth fade or slide animations when changing images.
Show small thumbnail previews below the main image.
Make it responsive for mobile screens.

Use a set of at least 5 images (you can use local images or any image URLs).
Your code should handle button clicks and update the displayed image dynamically.
Host your project or upload it to GitHub.
